# Heart Risk Predictor

## Project Goal
Build a machine learning model predicting heart disease risk using the UCI Heart Disease dataset and deliver:
- An interactive Streamlit dashboard
- A Jupyter/Colab notebook with full analysis and modeling
- A 1-page business/clinical insights report

This project combines **Biotech (clinical biomarkers)**, **Business (cost-saving recommendations)**, and **Data Analysis (full ML pipeline)**.

## Contents
- `notebook.ipynb`: exploratory analysis, data cleaning, logistic regression, and random forest modeling
- `app.py`: Streamlit dashboard (interactive risk predictor)
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `README.md`: project overview and instructions

## Tech Stack
- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `streamlit`
- Hosting: Streamlit Cloud
- Version control: GitHub

## How to Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
